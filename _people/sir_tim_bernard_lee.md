What would the world be like today without “www.”? Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web, revolutionizing the way people access and share information.

He created the first web browser, web server, and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that enables web pages to be displayed.

He laid out his vision for the internet-based sharing tool in 1989 while working at CERN and by 1991 others outside of CERN were invited to join the web.

Sir Tim not only invented the “www” that the internet still thrives on, but he fought to make sure the web stayed free and became accessible for anyone.

As the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, Berners-Lee continues to advocate for an open and accessible internet for everyone.
