Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is considered the first computer programmer.

She worked alongside Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, a general-purpose mechanical computer.

Lovelace wrote the first algorithm intended for processing by a machine, demonstrating the potential of a computing device to perform complex calculations.

Her visionary work continues to inspire computer scientists today.
