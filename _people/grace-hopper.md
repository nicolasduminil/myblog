Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist, was instrumental in the development of computer programming languages.

She created the first compiler, a program that translates high-level language code into machine-readable code.

Hopper was also involved in the creation of COBOL, one of the earliest high-level programming languages.

As a software engineer, her innovative work paved the way for many computer scientists who followed.
