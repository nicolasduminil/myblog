Alan Turing, one of the most famous computer scientists, was a mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst during World War II.

Turing made significant contributions to artificial intelligence, developing the Turing Test as a method for determining a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.

As a pioneer in theoretical computer science, he designed the Turing machine, which laid the foundation for modern computers.
