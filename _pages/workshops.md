## Resilient event-driven architecture and development using Java and Quarkus

This workshop is a continuous review of ready-to-use templates, examples, and patterns of reactive Java applications with Quarkus.
on Amazon Web Services, focusing on serverless. We will use Infrastructure as Java Code: AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK v2) for Java and use Maven repositories to quickly build and share the code.

In this workshop, I won't implement each application from scratch, rather than walk through already prepared ready-to-use examples and templates reflecting common patterns and adjust them to more specific use cases.

All changes, attendees' requests, and suggestions will be committed to a git repository in real-time.
