Spring Cloud is a Spring project which aims at providing tools for developers helping them to quickly implement some of the most common design patterns like configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, routing, proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions and much more.

One of the most interesting Spring Cloud sub-projects is Spring Cloud Streams which provides an annotation-driven framework to build message publishers and subscribers. It supports the most recent messaging platforms like RabbitMQ and Kafka and abstracts away their implementation details.

This project is demonstrating Spring Cloud Streams with Kafka platforms.
