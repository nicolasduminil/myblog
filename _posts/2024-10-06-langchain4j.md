Here we go again, the @agoncal 2024, which imminent release have been disclosed
by the author himself, a couple of weeks ago, on this same site,  is now available
on Amazon. "Yet another AI book", you might be tempted to think. But no, make no 
mistake, this one is different as the author manages to demystify, in less than 
200 pages (not to mention the appendixes), the essential of what everything is 
about in GenAI, ML, DL, LLM, FM and I could go on best.

This isn't an AI book as you might have seen at Manning or Packt, in fact it 
isn't even an AI book but, as its title suggests to the insightful readers that
you are, a book or, even better, a fascicle, dedicated to you, Java developers,
demonstrating how to integrate GenAI in your preferred ecosystem, on the behalf
of the Langchain4j library.

The book is structured in 5 parts. The first one, titled First Steps,  addresses
the GenAI's most fundamentals concepts and terms. It goes from the AI basics to
RAG (*Retrival Augmented Generation*) passing through models, prompts, hallucinations,
tokens, embeddings and vector databases, everything sprinkled by Langchain4j code
examples.

The second part, named Models, is a panorama of the different LLMs supported by 
Langchain4j, classified in accordance to their main destination, be them language,
chat, moderation or image models. The notion of model provider is introduced as 
well, together with their full list supported by Langchain4j. The most important
classes and interfaces are presented here in the form of class diagrams, giving 
this way a very concise, compact and, in the same time, exhaustive view of the
Langchain4j REST and Java client API (*Application Program Interface*).

In the third part, Retrieval Augmented Generation, the author takes us in a journey
to RAG and its subtleties like parsing, loading, transforming and splitting documents.
An important section is dedicated to embedding models, embedding stores, and their
counterpart in Langchain4j. The list of all the supported embedding stores is 
provided, together with their associated specialized APIs and illustrated with 
examples demonstrating how to use the Java client API in order to access these 
vector databases.

The fourth part, *Simplifying Generative AI*, moves us away from the lower-level
components, explained in the previous chapters, to more abstract and complex 
interactions into higher level AiServices. Here is where we're introduced to 
advanced techniques like facilitating the AI models access, streamlining message
handling or using extension tools able to improve the models capabilities.

Last but not least, the fifth part, *Conclusions*, is the practical application
of all the terms, notions, concepts and principles learned throughout the book.
The author remains attached to his sample application, Vintage Store, that he's
using since his very first book to illustrate the talk and, icing on the cake, 
even provides a full chatbot application. 60 pages of appendixes follow showing
how to install the development environment, the local model providers and how to
register with the remote ones.

In his foreword, Dmytro Liubarskyi, the Langchain4j creator, mentions Antonio's
exceptional capacity to resume things, as complicated as they might be, in a 
consistent and easy to understand manner. And as a matter of fact, I was once 
again impressed of how Antonio handles highly theoretical scientific concepts in
a discourse of style the "AI explained to my son".

To be honest, I was expecting myself to find a text that falls out of my hands,
full of complicated and tiresome explanations on NLP, encoding - decoding and 
other "attention is all you need" stuff. I was so pleased to find an interesting
book which reads itself in a couple of hours.

In conclusion, I couldn't recommend more this book which should stay on any Java
developer bookshelf.

And in order to avoid being too ecstatic and lyrical, I have to add a note of 
caution concerning the book presentation. The author has made the choice of the
self-publishing, probably consecutive to some setbacks with Apress at the occasion
of his previous book. While this is more than understandable, it impacts negatively
on the cover presentation, the paper quality as well as the page layout. Publishing
books is a profession in its own right. :-)
